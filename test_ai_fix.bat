echo Testing AI movement fix...
echo.
echo Key fixes implemented:
echo 1. Added _isAIControlled flag to Player class
echo 2. Modified ReturnPlayerInput() to not override AI input  
echo 3. AIController marks characters as AI-controlled
echo 4. Added enhanced debugging for position/velocity tracking
echo.
echo Please test the game to see if AI characters now follow Mario.
echo.
echo Expected behavior:
echo - AI characters should appear on track
echo - They should move towards the selected player character
echo - Debug output should show position changes and velocity
